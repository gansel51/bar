        <h2>Batch 2: Kama Citra IPA</h2>
        <p>
            A flirtatious fusion of American Pale Ale and West Coast IPA, Kama Citra is the session IPA that knows how to keep things interesting. Bold Citra hops take the lead, mingling with the classic Cascade and Centennial for a tropical, citrusy punch that dances across your palate. But it‚Äôs not all about hops‚ÄîKama Citra balances that bite with a smooth, soft malt backbone, making it effortlessly drinkable. Full of flavor but light on the ABV, this is the IPA that invites you to have another round. No restraint required.

        <h2>Batch 1: Halloween Hefe</h2>
        <p>
            Take a sip and you‚Äôre transported straight to a Bavarian Bier Hall. This medium-bodied, effervescent ale is a tribute to tradition‚Äîrich with yeasty, wheat malt character and a smooth mouthfeel. It‚Äôs like drinking liquid bread, but with a lively, zesty twist. Expect a dense, creamy head and a cloudy pour that delivers all the malty goodness. Serve it right with a swirl to capture the yeast, and you‚Äôve got a perfect pint of Bavaria‚Äôs finest. Cheers, mit hefe!        </p>
